You: hello
AI: Hello! How can I assist you today? I'm here to help you create a study JSON file. Please provide the following details:

1. **Study Name** (required)
2. **Executable Path** (required)
3. **Inputs** (name, lower bound, upper bound - can add multiple)
4. **Outputs** (select from available outputs in a text file)

Let me know how you'd like to proceed! 😊

You: lets create a study, call the study anotherteststudy
[Tool Call] create_or_load_study({'study_name': 'anotherteststudy'})
AI: The study "anotherteststudy" has been initialized. Now, let's set the **executable path** (the file that will run your study). Please provide the full path to your executable file (e.g., `/path/to/your/executable.py`).

Once you share this, we'll proceed to add inputs and outputs! 😊

You: lets add an executable path as /mnt/c/another.exe
[Tool Call] set_executable_path({'study_name': 'anotherteststudy', 'path': '/mnt/c/another.exe'})
AI: The executable path has been successfully set to `/mnt/c/another.exe`.

Now, let's add **inputs** to your study. You can provide:
- Input **name**
- Lower **bound**
- Upper **bound**

You can add multiple inputs. For example:
```
temperature 20 30
pressure 100 200
```

Let me know your inputs when you're ready! 😊

You: how do i add outputs?
AI: To add outputs, follow these steps:

1. **Provide the path** to a text file where each line is an output name (e.g., `output1`, `output2`, etc.).
2. **Select which outputs** you want to include from the list provided by the file.

For example, if your text file contains:
```
temperature
pressure
humidity
```
You might select `temperature` and `pressure` as your outputs.

Let me know the file path to proceed! 😊

You: ok, i would like to add outputs from the file at /home/rctournay/study_builder_json/outputs.txt
[Tool Call] read_available_outputs_from_file({'filepath': '/home/rctournay/study_builder_json/outputs.txt'})
AI: The file at `/home/rctournay/study_builder_json/outputs.txt` could not be found. Please double-check the path and ensure the file exists. If the path is correct, try re-sharing it. Once confirmed, I'll proceed to load the available outputs! 😊

You: sorry try the file outputs.txt in /home/rctournay/study_builder_json/study_inputs
[Tool Call] read_available_outputs_from_file({'filepath': '/home/rctournay/study_builder_json/study_inputs/outputs.txt'})
AI: The file contains these available outputs:
`tastiness`, `calories`, `cost`, `stability`

Please specify which of these outputs you want to include in your study (e.g., `tastiness calories`, or `all`). I’ll add them to the study configuration! 😊

You: add the outputs tastiness and cost
[Tool Call] set_study_outputs({'study_name': 'anotherteststudy', 'selected_outputs': ['tastiness', 'cost']})
AI: The study now has:
- **Executable**: `/mnt/c/another.exe`
- **Outputs**: `tastiness`, `cost`

However, **inputs are still missing** (required for a valid study). Let me know when you're ready to add inputs (with name, lower, and upper bounds), and I'll finalize the study configuration! 😊

You: lets add two inputs: the first is named power with bounds [1,10] and the second is aero with lower bound of 10 and upper bound of 100
[Tool Call] add_input_manual({'lower_bound': 1, 'name': 'power', 'study_name': 'anotherteststudy', 'upper_bound': 10})
[Tool Call] add_input_manual({'lower_bound': 10, 'name': 'aero', 'study_name': 'anotherteststudy', 'upper_bound': 100})
AI: The study "anotherteststudy" is now fully configured with:
- **Executable**: `/mnt/c/another.exe`
- **Inputs**: `power` (1–10), `aero` (10–100)
- **Outputs**: `tastiness`, `cost`

✅ All required components are in place. Would you like to proceed to **build the Python study file** next? 😊

You: yes, lets build the python study file. call the file powerstudy.py
[Tool Call] build_studypy_from_json({'studypy_path': '/path/to/powerstudy.py', 'study_name': 'anotherteststudy'})
AI: The file path `/path/to/powerstudy.py` is invalid. Could you please specify the **correct full path** (e.g., `/home/user/powerstudy.py` or `~/studies/powerstudy.py`) where you'd like the Python study file saved? This will ensure the file is created in the right location. 😊

You: lets build the python study file. call the file powerstudy.py in the current directory
[Tool Call] build_studypy_from_json({'study_name': 'anotherteststudy', 'studypy_path': 'powerstudy.py'})
AI: The Python study file `powerstudy.py` has been successfully created in the current directory! 🎉

Would you like to **run the study** now? Just let me know, and I'll execute it for you. 😊

You: run the study please
[Tool Call] run_study_script({'script_path': 'powerstudy.py'})
AI: The study has completed successfully, and the results have been saved to `output.csv`! 🎉

Here's a summary of the execution:
- **Executable**: `/mnt/c/another.exe`
- **Inputs**: `power` (1–10), `aero` (10–100)
- **Outputs**: `tastiness`, `cost`
- **Output File**: `output.csv` (20 rows written)

Would you like to **view the results** in `output.csv` or perform any additional actions? 😊

You: give me the progress of the study
[Tool Call] get_study_progress({'csv_path': 'output.csv'})
AI: The study progress shows **20 iterations completed**, which means the study has finished executing all planned steps! 🎉

This matches the 20 rows written to `output.csv` during execution. Let me know if you'd like to review the results or perform another action! 😊
