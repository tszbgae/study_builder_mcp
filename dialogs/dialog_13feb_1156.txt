You: i would like to create a study called studytest
[Tool Call] create_or_load_study({'study_name': 'studytest'})
AI: The study "studytest" has been successfully created and is now active. It currently has no benchmark function or parameters defined. Would you like to:

1. Add a benchmark function to optimize (e.g., "rosenbrock", "ackley", "sphere")?
2. Manually define a custom objective function?
3. Perform another action (e.g., check available functions, load a study, etc.)?

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed!

You: what tools do you have available for me to use?
AI: Here are the tools available for your study setup and optimization workflow:

**1. Study Management**
- `create_or_load_study`: Initializes a new study or loads an existing one (already used for "studytest")

**2. Executable Setup**
- `set_executable_path`: Specifies the path to an external executable file for evaluation

**3. Input Parameter Management**
- `add_input_manual`: Manually define a single parameter (name, lower/upper bounds)
- `add_inputs_from_csv`: Load multiple parameters from a CSV file (requires "name", "lower_bound", "upper_bound" columns)

**4. Output Specification**
- `read_available_outputs_from_file`: List available output metrics from a .txt file
- `set_study_outputs`: Select which output metrics to track for your study

**5. Diagnostic Tool**
- `get_study_status`: Validates your study configuration and shows what's missing

Would you like guidance on any specific tool or help with the next step in your optimization setup?

You: for studytest, lets set the executable to '/mnt/c/study.ext'
[Tool Call] set_executable_path({'study_name': 'studytest', 'path': '/mnt/c/study.ext'})
AI: The executable path has been successfully set for your study. Now, let's continue with your study setup. Would you like to:

1. **Add input parameters** (e.g., define variables to optimize)?
2. **Check your study status** to verify current configuration?
3. **Proceed to optimization** (if parameters are already defined)?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!

You: i would like to add an input parameter called cheese, lower bound 0 upper bound 5.5
[Tool Call] add_input_manual({'name': 'cheese', 'study_name': 'studytest', 'upper_bound': 5.5, 'lower_bound': 0})
AI: The input parameter "cheese" has been successfully added to your study. Your study now has:

- **Executable**: `/mnt/c/study.ext`
- **Inputs**: `cheese` (0 ≤ cheese ≤ 5.5)
- **Outputs**: Not yet defined

Would you like to:
1. **Define the objective function** (e.g., select a benchmark like "rosenbrock" or "ackley")?
2. **Set output metrics** to track during optimization?
3. **Proceed to run trials** (if the executable handles the objective)?

Let me know how you'd like to continue!

You: i would like to add another input called bacon upper bound 6 and lower bound -6.6
[Tool Call] add_input_manual({'name': 'bacon', 'study_name': 'studytest', 'upper_bound': 6, 'lower_bound': -6.6})
AI: The input parameter "bacon" has been successfully added to your study. Your study now has:

- **Executable**: `/mnt/c/study.ext`
- **Inputs**:
  - `cheese` (0 ≤ cheese ≤ 5.5)
  - `bacon` (-6.6 ≤ bacon ≤ 6)
- **Outputs**: Not yet defined

Would you like to:
1. **Define the objective function** (e.g., select a benchmark like "rosenbrock" or "ackley")?
2. **Set output metrics** to track during optimization?
3. **Proceed to run trials** (if the executable handles the objective)?

Let me know how you'd like to continue!

You: i would like to add outputs from /home/rctournay/study_builder_json/study_inputs/outputs.txt
[Tool Call] read_available_outputs_from_file({'filepath': '/home/rctournay/study_builder_json/study_inputs/outputs.txt'})
AI: The file contains these available outputs:
`tastiness`, `calories`, `cost`, `stability`

Please specify which of these outputs you'd like to track in your study (e.g., "tastiness and cost" or "all"). I'll configure the study outputs accordingly.

You: i would like to add outputs tastiness and stability to studytest
[Tool Call] set_study_outputs({'selected_outputs': ['tastiness', 'stability'], 'study_name': 'studytest'})
AI: Your study "studytest" is now fully configured with:

- **Executable**: `/mnt/c/study.ext`
- **Inputs**:
  - `cheese` (0 ≤ cheese ≤ 5.5)
  - `bacon` (-6.6 ≤ bacon ≤ 6)
- **Outputs**: `tastiness`, `stability`

✅ All required components are defined. Would you like to:
1. **Start the optimization process** (generate the first trial)?
2. **Validate/Check Study Status** (confirm all parameters are correctly set)?
3. **Modify/Update** any configuration (e.g., add more inputs/outputs)?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
