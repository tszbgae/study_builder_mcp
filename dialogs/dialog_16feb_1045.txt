You: i would like to create a study called teststudy16feb
[Tool Call] create_or_load_study({'study_name': 'teststudy16feb'})
AI: I've created the study "teststudy16feb". Now let's define the optimization objective. Please select a benchmark function from the available list:

1. **Sphere**: f(x) = x₁² + x₂² + ... + xₙ²
2. **Rosenbrock**: f(x) = Σₙ (100(xᵢ₊₁ - xᵢ²)² + (1 - xᵢ)²)
3. **Rastrigin**: f(x) = Σₙ (xᵢ² - 10cos(2πxᵢ) + 10)
4. **Ackley**: f(x) = -a cos(2πx₁) - b cos(2πx₂) + ... + c
5. **Griewank**: f(x) = Σₙ (xᵢ²/4000) - Πₙ cos(xᵢ) + 1

Would you like to use one of these, or specify a custom function?

You: i need to set the executable path in teststudyfeb16 to /mnt/c/test.exe
[Tool Call] set_executable_path({'path': '/mnt/c/test.exe', 'study_name': 'teststudyfeb16'})
AI: The executable path has been successfully set to `/mnt/c/test.exe` for your study. Now, let's define the optimization objective. Please select a benchmark function from the available list:

1. **Sphere**
2. **Rosenbrock**
3. **Rastrigin**
4. **Ackley**
5. **Griewank**

Or specify a **custom function** if none of these fit your needs.

You: i would like to add an input parameter called speed, lower bound 0 upper bound 5.5
[Tool Call] add_input_manual({'lower_bound': 0, 'name': 'speed', 'study_name': 'teststudyfeb16', 'upper_bound': 5.5})
AI: The input parameter "speed" has been successfully added to your study with bounds [0, 5.5].

Would you like to:
1. Add more input parameters?
2. Select a benchmark function as the optimization objective?
3. Start the optimization experiment?

You: what is the study name of the study we are currently working on
AI: The study name for the current project is **teststudyfeb16**. All actions you've taken so far (setting the executable path, adding the "speed" input parameter) are associated with this study.

You: i would like to add a second input parameter called agility, lower bound -10 upper bound 10
[Tool Call] add_input_manual({'study_name': 'teststudyfeb16', 'upper_bound': 10, 'lower_bound': -10, 'name': 'agility'})
AI: The input parameter "agility" has been successfully added to your study with bounds [-10, 10].

Would you like to:
1. Add more input parameters?
2. Select a benchmark function as the optimization objective?
3. Start the optimization experiment?

You: i would like to add outputs from /home/rctournay/study_builder_json/study_inputs/outputs.txt
[Tool Call] read_available_outputs_from_file({'filepath': '/home/rctournay/study_builder_json/study_inputs/outputs.txt'})
AI: The file contains the following available outputs:
- tastiness
- calories
- cost
- stability

Please specify which of these outputs you would like to add to your study (you can select multiple). For example: "I want to track tastiness and stability".

You: please add all four outputs to our study teststudyfeb16
[Tool Call] set_study_outputs({'selected_outputs': ['tastiness', 'calories', 'cost', 'stability'], 'study_name': 'teststudyfeb16'})
AI: The study "teststudyfeb16" now has:
- **Inputs**: speed (0–5.5), agility (–10–10)
- **Outputs**: cost, tastiness, calories, stability
- **Executable path**: /mnt/c/test.exe

Now, we need to define the **optimization objective**. Please select a benchmark function from the list:

1. **Sphere**
2. **Rosenbrock**
3. **Rastrigin**
4. **Ackley**
5. **Griewank**

Or specify a **custom function** if none of these fit your needs.

You: lets build the studypy file from our study json.  call the study python file study.py
[Tool Call] build_studypy_from_json({'study_name': 'teststudyfeb16', 'studypy_path': 'study.py'})
AI: The `study.py` file has been successfully generated based on your study configuration (`teststudyfeb16`). This file now contains the full setup for your optimization experiment, including:

- Input parameters (`speed`, `agility`)
- Output metrics (`cost`, `tastiness`, `calories`, `stability`)
- Executable path (`/mnt/c/test.exe`)

Would you like to:
1. **Run the optimization experiment** using this setup?
2. **Review the contents of `study.py`** to verify the configuration?
3. **Make further adjustments** to the study before starting?

You: excellent
AI: The `study.py` file is ready! To proceed, please confirm what you'd like to do next:

1. **Run the optimization experiment** (this will execute the study and start the optimization loop)
2. **Review the `study.py` file** (I'll show you the generated code)
3. **Make adjustments** (e.g., modify parameters, add constraints, etc.)

Let me know your choice!

You: what is the name of the first us president
AI: The first President of the United States was **George Washington**. He served from 1789 to 1797.

Let me know if you'd like to return to your study setup or need further clarification! 😊
